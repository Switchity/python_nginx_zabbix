WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface):
This is the older standard for Python web applications. It's a synchronous protocol.
Servers like Waitress, Gunicorn, and uWSGI are built to work with WSGI applications
(like Flask or Django). The protocol defines how the server passes a request (environ)
and receives a response (start_response).

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface):
This is the newer, modern standard for Python. It's designed to handle asynchronous and long-lived connections
(like websockets). Frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, and Quart are built on the ASGI standard. The protocol
requires the server to pass three arguments: scope, receive, and send.

The traceback you're seeing shows that Waitress, which is a WSGI server, is trying to call your FastAPI
application with the two WSGI arguments (environ and start_response). Your FastAPI application, however,
expects the three ASGI arguments (scope, receive, and send), leading to the TypeError because the send argument is missing.

Run your application with Uvicorn:


Install zabbix-agent on the Python server:

Monitor CPU, memory, disk, network.

Custom checks: request latency, request count, error rate (via logs or app metrics).

3.3 Zabbix Server

Collects data from agents and SNMP/http checks.

Templates:

Template App Nginx by Zabbix agent

Template OS Linux by Zabbix agent

Custom template for Python API metrics

🔹 Step 4: Visualization

In Zabbix Dashboard or Grafana (via Zabbix plugin), visualize:

Traffic (RPS, bandwidth)

Latency (95th percentile response time)

Error rates (4xx, 5xx)

System CPU, memory, disk

Nginx connections (active, waiting)

Requests dropped by rate limiting

Example dashboards:

Nginx Load Control Efficiency

Python API Performance

System Health

✅ Benefits of This Setup

Nginx: absorbs traffic spikes, protects backend.

Python API: focused only on business logic.

Zabbix: gives observability into both Nginx & API.

Scalability: can add more API servers under Nginx upstream.

Visual Insights: proactive detection of overload situations.
